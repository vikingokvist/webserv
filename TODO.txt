TODO limits

- IF netcat and you leave connection open, the server shouldnt hang indefenitely, and close the connection

- check in request if non-ascii characters

- Checkar que todo tire errores correctos a std::cerr

- Checking the value of errno to adjust the server behaviour is strictly forbidden
after performing a read or write operation

- CHECK redirect (return 300 iuhwfufhe/iwuefggiwef/ifieggf)

- Default file to serve when the requested resource is a directory.

- Just remember that, for chunked requests, your server needs to un-chunk
them, the CGI will expect EOF as the end of the body.

- The same applies to the output of the CGI. If no content_length is
returned from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data.

- Check in ConfigParser that redirect only Allows the following formats:
        - return 421;
        - return 234 "http://url.com"
        - return 123 "string"
        - return "url"  (WRONG)


- UPLOAD STORE ERROR
