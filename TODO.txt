TODO limits

- Checking the value of errno to adjust the server behaviour is strictly forbidden
after performing a read or write operation

- Default file to serve when the requested resource is a directory.

- Just remember that, for chunked requests, your server needs to un-chunk
them, the CGI will expect EOF as the end of the body.

- The same applies to the output of the CGI. If no content_length is
returned from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data.
